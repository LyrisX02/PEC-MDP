# PEC-MDP

This repository consists of a main Python code file 'PEC_Parser.py' for parsing and translating a PEC domain description into PEC-MDP components, as well as compiling the components into a functioning PEC-MDP.

This translator and executor was developped in Python 3.11.2. Requirments include:

* numpy >= 1.24.2
* regex >= 2023.10.3

A comphrensive tutorial and demonstration of how the developped modules in 'PEC_Parser.py' may be used is found in the Python notebook 'PEC_notebook.ipynb'.

This repository also contains examples of PEC domain descriptions showcasing the different properties that may be modelled into a PEC-MDP. These files are named in the form 'PEC_example_n'.
 
Refer to 'PEC_notebook.ipynb' for a more detailed description of the utilities of the PEC-MDP modules.
